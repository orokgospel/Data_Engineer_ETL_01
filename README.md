# gospel_ETL_for_dataeng
This is my ETL as well as the logging Python Project for Data Engineering.

In this project I did the following:
-Run the ETL process
-Extract bank and market cap data from the JSON file bank_market_cap.json
-Transform the market cap currency using the exchange rate data
-Load the transformed data into a seperate CSV

Also went ahead to use the learning experience and project to carry out an ETL project that performs the following:
- Read or collect inputted batch pumping parameters of petroleum product from source station or depot.
- Transform the collected data.
- Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load csv format which data engineers can use to load into an RDBMS or Data Analyst/Scientist can use for Analysis.
