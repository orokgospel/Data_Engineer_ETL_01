# gospel_ETL_for_dataeng
This is my ETL as well as the logging Python Project for Data Engineering.

In this project I did the following:
-Run the ETL process
-Extract bank and market cap data from the JSON file bank_market_cap.json
-Transform the market cap currency using the exchange rate data
-Load the transformed data into a seperate CSV
